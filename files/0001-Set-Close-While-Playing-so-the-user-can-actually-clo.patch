       <summary>Whether to close the player's window instead of hiding/minimizing it when a song is still playing. The window can be brought back by activating its desktop file.</summary>
       <description>When enabled, the window will be closed even if a song is still being played (i.e. close = quit). Otherwise, if a song is being played, the application will not be closed, but minimized/hidden. The player is minimized or hidden depending on the values of the minimize-while-playing-shells key.</description>
